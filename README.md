# lunchbot

Allow slash-commands in Slack to get lunch or coffee suggestions.

You'll need a working `.env` file or some other way to get the two items in
`.env-sample` (but changed to your correct values) into the evnrionment
variables accessible by the code. Different hosting providers offer different
options. I use Zeit/now with their `now secret` option. Search their docs and
look at the `now.json` file in this repo to see how it works.
